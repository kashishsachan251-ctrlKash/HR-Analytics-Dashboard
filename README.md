* Bachelor’s degree professionals
* Operational technical roles

---

### Recommended Actions

1. Improve job satisfaction through career growth plans
2. Introduce role-specific retention programs in R&D & Sales
3. Provide early-career mentoring and promotion pathways
4. Review workload and performance pressure in technical roles
5. Strengthen employee engagement programs

### Conclusion

Attrition is driven primarily by career progression gaps rather than workforce dissatisfaction across the company.
Strategic, targeted HR interventions can significantly reduce turnover and improve workforce stability.
